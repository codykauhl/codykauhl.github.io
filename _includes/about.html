                <h4>Artistic Statement</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an electronic composer/digital media artist, I record and then delicately arrange inconspicuous or disregarded sound sources, producing an intimate human agency from otherwise lifeless objects. By doing so, I reinterpret the sound saturation of daily life as a liberating yet introverted experience. The resulting product often juxtaposes the delicate and visceral, the intricate and sparse, while maintaining an unabashed intimacy throughout. I conceive the development of these works as a linear transformation, much like an extended crossfade between two film scenes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another critical component of my art practice utilizes data-driven instruments. When preparing to create a new composition, I develop programs that read information retrieved by accelerometers, webcams, and infrared cameras in order to create expressive musical instruments or sound modifiers. By creating new methods of human computer interaction, I endeavor to perform with electronics with as much physical expressivity and audience interaction as any acoustic instrument.</p>
